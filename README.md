# GestureBasedRobotInteraction
This is Final year MTech project. In this project we build a GUI and setup Robot model using unity.
This project aims to simplify the previous techniques of providing instructions to robot and perform tasks.
Here we developed a platform where user can give series of instructions using sketch(Simple shapes on screen) and our model will predict the shape and according to that give instructions to robot.
Advantages over general HRI interfaces:
1. Easy to interact
2. User need not sit and give instruction like hand based instruction mechanism
3. Robot is smart enough to guess what needs to be done. eg. You select cubes and tray then model is enough intelligent to guess cubes need to be place in tray and not a vice versa.
